## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

Please remove this subsection before submitting your report. 

## Challenge #1 Complete

In the class QueryEngineModule I changed FakeQueryEngine to a WikipediaAnalyzer.

## Challenge #2 Complete

I added an interface called Projectinterface and implemented it in the RevisionFormatter class
after that I fixed up the format of the time stamp to make what you are reading make more sense
 to the viewer.


## Challenge #3 Complete

In the wikipediaAnalyzer class I first commented out the for loop and replaced it then replaced it with a 
line of code and eventually just erased the for loop.

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

In functional programing, recursion is often used for iterative data whereas in OO,
we use loops for iterative data. When we concatenated the for loop in challenge 3 I used
functional data because it was more efficient that using the for loop. I prefer functional
approaches because they tend to be more efficient when working.


## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

Polymorphism helps do one task in many ways by overriding which is sometimes convenient depending 
on what you are coding. We see this in challenge 2 where we have to override in the RevisionFormatter
class. It engendered the dependency inversion because dependency inversion is providing dependencies from 
a class outside rather than having a class create its own dependencies which is not what we did by using
polymorphism.
